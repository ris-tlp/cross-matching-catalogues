# Catalogue Crossmatcher

Script that implements a crossmatching algorithm. Searches a second catalogue to find a counterpart for each object in the first catalogue. The coordinates in the two catalogues use the [Equatorial coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system). To calculate the offset/distance between two objects, the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) is used.

The two catalogues used are:  

- [All Sky Galaxy Catalogue](http://ssa.roe.ac.uk/allSky) generated by the [UK Schmidt Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Schmidt_Telescope). This script demonstrated crossmatching using a smaller sample of the `SCOS_XSC_mCl1_B21.5_R20_noStepWedges.csv.gz` file. This is the optical survey.

- [Bright Source Sample](http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?J/MNRAS/384/775) of the survey carried out by the [Australia Telescope Compact Array](https://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/). This is the radio survey.

## Why crossmatch?

In this scenario, finding optical identifications for most of the radio sources allows us to see the different types of galaxies that can host supermassive black holes and also learn more about [Active Galactic Nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus).
